* REQUIREMENTS

    + Unix platfrom
    + OpenCL compatible GPU (or CPU)
    
    + gcc (>=4.1)
    + libpng (>=1.2.x) (apt-get install libpng12-dev)
    + png++ (0.2.1, but other version should work well too) (apt-get install libpng++-dev)
    + OpenCL SDK (>= 1.0, tested with v1.1)
        - to get OpenCL dev files on
            Linux:  Install proprietary drivers for NVIDIA/AMD GPUs and 'opencl-headers'
                    or install Intel OpenCL SDK for Intel GPUs and CPUs
            Mac OSX: Install XCode
            Windows: Should be same as for Linux, but to compile this code you
                     should deal with the sys/time.h and similar staff first :)


* COMPILATION AND EXECUTION
        
    1. Change to directory in which this README is placed
    2. Type 'make'
    3. Type 'make run'
    
    
* NOTES
    + Executable is placed in directory './bin' and is named 'seminar'
    + Executable MUST be executed from directory '.', or
	in other words, from directory in which this README is placed
    + To find out executable arguments, execute it without any
    
    
* NOTES ON SOURCE CODE
    + OpenCL framework subset in wrapped into a simple C++ wrapper called 'oclw'
	You can use this wrapper to do basic staff on OpenCL compatible device.
	
	To get more info about the wrapper, consult:
	./docs/html/index.html or
	./docs/latex/refman.pdf

\mainpage OpenCL Wrapper

\section intro_sec Introduction

The OCLW is a wrapper of the OpenCL framework intended to simplify usage of OpenCL
for educational use. It wraps only a subset of the OpenCL framework.
You can use this wrapper to do basic operations on the OpenCL compatible device.

This project is a part of the seminar work on potential of GPUs at 
performing image processing related algorithms.

\section tut How to use OCLW

\subsection basic Basic concept

1. Use 'Controler' singleton to initialize OpenCL (just get reference to shared object)
2. For any memory object (eg array) create corresponding 'MemoryBuffer' object
3. Load and compile OpenCL code using 'Program' object
4. Create 'Kernel' object(s) using previously created 'Program' object
5. Perform tasks by executing 'Kernel' object

\subsection xmlp Example

The following shows a simple OpenCL kernel that just sets each element of an array to its absolute value:
    
<em>simple_program.cl:</em>
\code
__kernel void simple_kernel(__global int* data) {
    unsigned int u = get_global_id(0);

    data[u] = abs(data[u]);
}
\endcode

To use that kernel on some array, do something like this:    
\code
int data[1024];
// Load data for processing to 'data' array

// Get reference to Controller object
oclw::Controller* controller = oclw::Controller::shared();

// Create corresponding MemoryBuffer object for 'data' array
oclw::MemoryBuffer* data_gpu = controller->createMemoryBuffer(oclw::MemoryBuffer::READ_WRITE, sizeof(int)*1024);

// Transfer 'data' array to GPU
data_gpu->writeData(data, sizeof(int)*1024);

// Create and compile Program from source
oclw::Program* program = controller->createProgramObject();
program->compileFromSourceFile("simple_program.cl");

// Get Kernel
oclw::Kernel* kernel = program->createKernel("simple_kernel");

// Set Kernel argument
kernel->setArgument(0, *data_gpu);

// Execture Kernel
kernel->execute(oclw::Kernel::NDRange::range1D(1024));

// Get processed data back
data_gpu->readData(data, sizeof(int)*1024);

// Array 'data' now contains data processed by 'simple_kernel'
\endcode
